Moniker
=======
Generate pseudo-random names.

Moniker is tiny python module for creating random names.
It is _very_ simple.


What it does

Generate pseudo-random, human-readable names that are fairly
easy to remember.

It can map a hashable to (e.g. UUID) to some fixed value.


What it does not
================
Map a name generated by moniker back to a hashable of some sort.
