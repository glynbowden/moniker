Moniker
=======
Generate pseudo-random names.

Moniker is tiny python module for creating random names.
It is _very_ simple.


What it does
============

Generate pseudo-random, human-readable names that are fairly
easy to remember.

It can map a hashable to (e.g. UUID) to some fixed value.


What it does not
================
Map a name generated by moniker back to a hashable of some sort.


Why
===
Why not?


Example Usage
============

    In [1]: import moniker
    
    In [2]: moniker.create_name()
    Out[2]: 'likely-dealt-pea-84'
    
    In [3]: moniker.create_name(0)
    Out[3]: 'magically-sparked-blossom'
    
    In [4]: %pdoc moniker.create_name
    Class Docstring:
        Create a random, semi-realistic, name. If add_number is != 0 (default 99) a
        number in range 1-add_number is added to the end of the name.
    
        If you include a hashable in the call to create_name the returned name is
        consistent across calls.
